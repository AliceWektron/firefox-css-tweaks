A collection of CSS tweaks for Firefox to customize its appearance and behavior. These tweaks are applied using the `userChrome.css` file, which allows for customizing the browser's UI.

## Tweaks

### Expand Vertical Tabs on Hover

This tweak enables vertical tabs in Firefox to automatically expand when hovering over them, displaying full tab titles with a smooth animation. This is a fork of [ENDE25/FIREFOX-tabs-hover-expand](https://github.com/ENDE25/FIREFOX-tabs-hover-expand).

#### Features

- Narrow tabs sidebar with icons only by default
- Full tabs with title and close button on hover
- Smooth animation when expanding tabs
- Support for pinned tabs
- Sidebar expands over the content area instead of pushing it
- Faster animation times than the original version
- Slightly wider expanded width than the original version

#### Demo

#### Known Issues

- The button to expand/collapse the sidebar will no longer work. This is because if this customization would respect it, tabs would remain expanded when the mouse leaves the sidebar, which is not the desired behavior. This would happen because FireFox automatically adds the `expanded` attribute when the button is clicked **and** when the mouse is over the sidebar. This prevents the CSS from distinguishing between the two cases, so instead it simply ignores the `expanded` attribute and only reacts to `:hover`.

### Better Active Tab Indicator

This tweak improves the visual indication of the currently active tab in Firefox. It provides a more pronounced indicator for the active tab compared to the default styling. This tweak is only for vertical tabs.

#### Features

- Enhanced visibility of the active tab
- Customizable color and width

## Installation

To install any or all of these tweaks, you must first enable `userChrome.css` support in Firefox and then copy the desired CSS files to the appropriate folders in your user profile directory. To do this, follow these steps:

### 1. Enable `userChrome.css` Support
1. Open Firefox and type in the address bar: `about:config` (accept the warning message if it appears).
1. Set the preference `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to `true`.

### 2. Find the User Profile Folder
1. Type in the address bar: `about:support`.
1. Look for the **Profile Folder** or **Profile Directory** section and click **Open Folder** or **Open Directory**.
1. Inside the profile folder, locate (or create if it doesn't exist) a folder named `chrome`, and inside it, another folder named `css`.

### 3. Apply Tweaks
1. Each tweak in this repository has its own folder under `css/`. Copy the folder of the tweak you want into the `chrome/css` folder in your user profile directory (the one you located/created in the previous step).
1. Copy the `userChrome.css` file from this repository into the `chrome` folder. If it already exists, append the content of this file to the existing one.
1. Uncomment the `@import` line for the tweak you want to apply in the `userChrome.css` file by removing the `/*` and `*/` around it.
1. Restart Firefox for the changes to take effect.

## Customization

Each tweak may provide customization options at the top of its `index.css` file. You can modify these values to change the appearance and behavior of the tweak to suit your preferences. For example, for `expand-vertical-tabs-on-hover`, the customization options may look like this:

```css
:root {
	--tweaks-evtoh-collapsed-width: 50px;
	--tweaks-evtoh-expanded-width: 250px;
	--tweaks-evtoh-tab-padding: 10px;
	--tweaks-evtoh-tab-margin: calc((var(--tweaks-evtoh-collapsed-width) - var(--tweaks-evtoh-tab-padding) * 2 - var(--icon-size-default)) / 2);
	--tweaks-evtoh-animation-duration: 50ms;
}
```

All customization options are in the `:root` selector and start with `--tweaks-<tweak-acronym>-`. Remember to restart Firefox after making changes to the customization options for them to take effect.
